# todo

+ basic auth
+ server sent events (SSE) about data changes

## apps

- simple chat with terminal like web shell, e.g. with command to change current channel
- built-in todo list channel

## cleanups

- (minor) consider moving SSE handler to github.com/gocontrib/pubsub
- SSE as separate process
